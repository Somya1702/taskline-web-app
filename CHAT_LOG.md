# Task Tracker Development Chat Log

## Project Overview
- **Original State**: Static HTML task tracker with basic UI
- **Current State**: Full-stack web application with database and deployment ready
- **Goal**: Convert static HTML to web application with database and hosting

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Backend Development
- ✅ Created Express.js server (`server.js`)
- ✅ Set up SQLite database with proper schema
- ✅ Implemented RESTful API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/tasks` - Get all tasks
  - `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
  - `PUT /api/tasks/:id` - Update task
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/:id` - Delete task
  - `GET /api/stats` - Get task statistics

### 2. Database Setup
- ✅ Created database initialization script (`init-database.js`)
- ✅ Added sample data for testing
- ✅ Database schema includes: id, name, resource, entity_group, entity, state, task_description, due_date, status, timestamps

### 3. Frontend Enhancements
- ✅ Completely rewrote `script.js` with API integration
- ✅ Added modal forms for creating/editing tasks
- ✅ Implemented real-time search functionality
- ✅ Added task statistics dashboard
- ✅ Created notification system
- ✅ Added export to CSV functionality
- ✅ Enhanced CSS with responsive design and modal styles

### 4. Deployment Configuration
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with all dependencies
- ✅ Created `Procfile` for Heroku deployment
- ✅ Added `.gitignore` for proper file exclusions
- ✅ Created comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions

## Current Issue
- Node.js installed but not recognized in current PowerShell session
- Need to restart terminal to recognize Node.js installation

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Restart PowerShell/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to project directory**: `cd C:\Users\team0\task-tracker`
3. **Verify Node.js**: `node --version` and `npm --version`
4. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
5. **Initialize database**: `npm run init-db`
6. **Start application**: `npm run dev`
7. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Deployment Options Available:
- **Heroku**: Free tier, easy deployment
- **Vercel**: Free tier, automatic deployments
- **Railway**: Free tier, GitHub integration
- **Any Node.js hosting service**
